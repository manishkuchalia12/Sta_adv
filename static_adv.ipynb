    "Q1: What are the Probability Mass Function (PMF) and Probability Density Function (PDF)? Explain with Probability Density Function (PDF):\r\n",
    "A Probability Density Function (PDF) is similar to the PMF but is used for continuous random variables. It describes the likelihood of a continuous random variable falling within a particular range. Unlike the PMF, the PDF does not give the probability at a specific point but rather the probability density over a range. The integral of the PDF over a range gives the probability of the variable falling within that range.Example:\r\n",
    "Consider a continuous random variable representing the height of individuals in a population. The PDF might be represented a f(x), where ï¿½\r\n",

    "Q4: Explain the importance of Normal Distribution. Give a few real-life examples of Normal \n",
    "Distribution.\n",
    "Ans:-The normal distribution is of great importance in statistics and probability theory due to several key properties and the prevalence of this distribution in various natural phenomena. Here are some reasons why the normal distribution is important:\n",
    "Central Limit Theorem (CLT): The normal distribution is a key component of the Central Limit Theorem. According to the CLT, the sum (or average) of a large number of independent and identically distributed random variables, regardless of the original distribution, will be approximately normally distributed. This property makes the normal distribution fundamental in statistical inference.\n",
    "Statistical Inference: Many statistical methods and tests are based on the assumption of normality. For example, t-tests and analysis of variance (ANOVA) assume that the data are normally distributed. The normal distribution simplifies the mathematical computations involved in these statistical procedures.\n",
    "Parameter Estimation: In parametric statistics, the normal distribution is often used as a reference distribution for estimating parameters, such as mean and standard deviation, through methods like maximum likelihood estimation.\n",
    "Prediction and Forecasting: In various fields, including finance, economics, and environmental science, normal distribution is used for predicting future events. For instance, stock prices, economic indicators, and weather variables are often modeled assuming a normal distribution.\n",
    "Quality Control: In manufacturing and quality control processes, normal distribution is frequently used to model the distribution of product characteristics. It helps in setting tolerances and understanding the variability in production processes.\n",
    "Biological Phenomena: Many biological measurements, such as height, weight, and blood pressure, are approximately normally distributed in large populations. This makes the normal distribution a useful model for studying and understanding biological variations.\n",
    "Psychometrics: In psychology and psychometrics, test scores, IQ scores, and various psychological traits are often assumed to follow a normal distribution. This assumption forms the basis for many statistical analyses in these fields.\n",
    "Real-Life Examples of Normal Distribution:\n",
    "Heights of a Population: The distribution of heights in a large population tends to follow a normal distribution, with most people clustered around the average height.\n",
    "IQ Scores: Intelligence Quotient (IQ) scores are designed to follow a normal distribution, with a mean of 100 and a standard deviation of 15 in a standard IQ scale.\n",
    "Scores on Standardized Tests: Scores on standardized tests, such as SAT or GRE, are often assumed to be normally distributed.\n",
    "Errors in Measurements: Measurement errors, such as errors in scientific experiments or errors in industrial processes, often follow a normal distribution.\n",
    "Financial Returns: Daily or monthly financial returns in the stock market are often modeled using a normal distribution in financial analysis."
